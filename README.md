# World Language Starter Kit Contest

## Many of us would like to get an immersive language learning experience

* We often get stuck when we have the chance.

* We often don't know a word or phrase and are humiliated, but really we don't know how to ask for help!

### How can we get unstuck?

There are many phrases that are in many languages that can help a new speaker not lose face in a
meaningful conversation. We are compiling those here so people can keeping speaking in the language
that they are learning.

### How can you help?

We will be starting a contest here soon where people can submit a pull request to make a cheet sheet for
any language other than English. If you don't know how to participate, you can [go to our repo's issues to
ask for help](https://github.com/InstaMarch/world-language-starter-kit/issues).

### An example cheatsheet in English expressed in Markdown .

```
* How do you say “word” in English?

* What does “this expression” mean?

* Did I say that correctly?

* How do you pronounce "word?"

* How do I say "this is" in the future tense?

* How do I say "this is" in the past tense?
```

### Submission Instructions

cheatsheet similar to the existing English sheet.
